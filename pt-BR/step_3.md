You might also want to get back to a previous costume using the left arrow key. To do this you need to use the `costume number`{:class="block3looks"} and subtract `1` from it.

```blocks3
when [left arrow v] key pressed
switch costume to ((costume [number v]) - (1))
```

In the **Costumes** tab, you can select all the parts of a costume by holding down the Ctrl key on your keyboard and then pressing the letter A key. You can then move and resize each costume so they are in the correct place.
